This program is a replica of the Enigma Machine, a WWII cypher device:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine

I used rotors I, II, III, IV, and V, and reflectors A, B, and C from this website:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details

To use, edit the machine settings at the bottom of the program and then write a message using machine.decode("message")

You can find example cyphers here:
